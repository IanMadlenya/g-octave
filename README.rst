Introduction
------------

What is GNU Octave?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving
linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical
experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab.
It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.


What is Octave Forge?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Octave-Forge is a central location for the collaborative development of
packages for GNU Octave.

The Octave-forge packages contains the source for all the functions and
are designed to work with the Octave package system. In general the packages
are designed to work with the latest development version of Octave, but
it should be possible to use most packages with earlier versions. 


What is g-octave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

g-octave is a tool that generates and installs ebuilds for Octave-Forge
packages "on-the-fly" to Gentoo Linux, using Portage. It's capable to
generate ebuilds and Manifest files for the packages, and to install
them using an autogenerated overlay (named g-octave). g-octave can also
handle patches to the packages automatically. The command line interface
tries to be very similar to the interface of the **emerge** tool.

At this moment g-octave depends on the Portage package manager to works,
but the support to Paludis and pkgcore is planned.

To-Do
-----

We have other goals besides implementing the remaining features:

* Improve the code comments
* Improve the error handling
* Improve the overlay management
* Write a man page
* Convince upstream to distribute a package database
* Improve the use as a normal user, using "--pretend"
* Improve the script to generate the package database
* Improve the details available on the packages list
* more...


CLI options
-----------

*--version*
    show program's version number and exit

*-h, --help*
    show this help message and exit

*-l, --list*
    show a list of packages available to install and exit

*-i, --info*
    show a description of the required package and exit

*-p, --pretend*
    don't (un)merge packages, only create ebuilds and solve the dependencies

*-a, --ask*
    ask to confirmation before perform (un)merges

*-v, --verbose*
    Portage makes a lot of noise.

*-C, --unmerge*
    try to unmerge a package instead of merge

*-f, --force*
    forces the recreation of the ebuilds

*--force-all*
    forces the recreation of the overlay and of the ebuilds

*--no-colors*
    don't use colors on the CLI
