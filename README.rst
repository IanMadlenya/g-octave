g-octave
========

Introduction
------------

What is GNU Octave?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`GNU Octave`_ is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving
linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical
experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab.
It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.


What is Octave Forge?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Octave-Forge`_ is a central location for the collaborative development of
packages for `GNU Octave`_.

The `Octave-Forge`_ packages contains the source for all the functions and
are designed to work with the `GNU Octave`_ package system. 


What is g-octave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`g-octave`_ is a tool that generates and installs ebuilds for `Octave-Forge`_
packages "on-the-fly" to `Gentoo Linux`_, using Portage_. It's capable to
generate ebuilds and Manifest files for the packages, and to install
them using an autogenerated overlay (named g-octave). `g-octave`_ can also
handle patches to the packages automatically. The command line interface
tries to be very similar to the interface of the **emerge** tool.

At this moment `g-octave`_ depends on the Portage_ package manager to works,
but the support to Paludis_ and pkgcore_ is planned.


Features
--------

Below is a list of features implemented and planned to the next releases.

* Selection of the packages by name-version **(done)**
* Selection of the packages by name (using the latest version available)
  **(done)**
* Creation of the ebuilds **(done)**
* Creation of the Manifest files **(done)**
* Creation of the overlay automatically **(done)**
* Installation of the packages automatically **(done)**
* Update of the packages already installed
* Remotion of the installed packages **(done)**

* Supports multiple versions of the same package **(done)**
* Download auxiliary files (patches, blacklist, dependency list, package
  database and the eclass) from a mirror using wget **(done)**
* The user can choose with which download manager will fetch these files
* The user can force the recreation of an ebuild **(done)**
* The user can force the recreation of the overlay **(done)**
* Mask a package to be installed, based on the blacklist, provided by the
  maintainer of `g-octave`_ **(done)**
* Show the masked packages on the list of packages, with an alert
* Resolution of the dependencies of packages from the Portage tree, based
  on the dependency list, provided by the maintainer of `g-octave`_ **(done)**
* Supports the installation of multiple packages (not only the dependencies)
* Handle updates of the eclass and the auxiliary files automatically **(done)**
* Alert the user that the `g-octave`_ overlay is not appended to the
  PORTDIR_OVERLAY environment variable **(done)**
* Support to Portage_ **(done)**
* Support to Paludis_
* Support to pkgcore_
* Configuration file to the main settings */etc/g-octave.cfg* **(done)**
* Use colors on the CLI **(done)**
* The user can disable the use of colors on the CLI **(done)**
* Logging `g-octave`_ actions


To-Do
-----

We have other goals besides implementing the remaining features:

* Port to Python_ >= 3.0
* Improve the code comments
* Improve the error handling
* Improve the overlay management
* Write a man page
* Convince upstream to distribute the package database
* Improve the use of `g-octave`_ as a normal user, with "--pretend"
* Improve the script that generate the package database
* Improve the details available on the packages list
* more...


CLI options
-----------

*--version*
    show program's version number and exit

*-h, --help*
    show this help message and exit

*-l, --list*
    show a list of packages available to install and exit

*-i, --info*
    show a description of the required package and exit

*-p, --pretend*
    don't (un)merge packages, only create ebuilds and solve the dependencies

*-a, --ask*
    ask to confirmation before perform (un)merges

*-v, --verbose*
    Portage makes a lot of noise.

*-C, --unmerge*
    try to unmerge a package instead of merge

*-f, --force*
    forces the recreation of the ebuilds

*--force-all*
    forces the recreation of the overlay and of the ebuilds

*--no-colors*
    don't use colors on the CLI


Usage Examples
--------------

Install the latest version of *control*: ::
    
    # g-octave control

Install the version 1.0.11 of *control*: ::

    # g-octave control-1.0.11

Remove the package *control*: ::

    # g-octave -C control

Get informations about the package *control*: ::

    # g-octave -i control
    
The options *verbose*, *ask* and *pretend* are passed to **emerge**.


Dependencies
------------

`g-octave`_ have some basic dependencies:

* Python_ 2
* Portage_
* simplejson_
* pycolors_ (to use colors on the CLI, it's an optional dependency)


How can I help?
---------------

The users can help testing and reporting bugs in our `issue tracker`_.
If you can help programming in Python_, please take a look at our missing
features and at the To-Do list. :)

`g-octave`_ ebuilds are available here:
http://overlay.rafaelmartins.eng.br/


Warning
-------

If you experienced some random errors when installing some package, please
retry, using the option *--force-all*, and report the issue to us.
If you don't want to lose all your ebuilds, you can try to use the option
*--force*, that will recreate only the affected ebuild.
