User Guide
==========

This is a small user guide for g-Octave, with some instructions to the
end user.


Installing g-Octave
-------------------

The ebuilds for g-Octave will be available on the Portage tree as soon
as possible. For now, they can be found on my overlay:

http://overlay.rafaelmartins.eng.br/

After you have the overlay installed, you can install the package, using: ::
    
    # emerge -av app-portage/g-octave

We have 2 ebuilds, one for the latest stable release (for ``~x86`` and ``~amd64``)
and one live ebuild, that installs g-Octave from the mercurial repository
(without keywords). If you want to use the live ebuild, you need to unmask
this ebuild, adding this to ``/etc/portage/package.keywords``::

    app-portage/g-octave **

The live ebuild is only recommended for who want to help testing new
features, or for developers.

Stable users (with x86 or amd64) that wants to test the latest release
will need to unmask the ebuild too, adding this to
/etc/portage/package.keywords (e.g. for ``x86``)::

    app-portage/g-octave ~x86

The source code of g-Octave can be found in this Mercurial repository:

http://hg.rafaelmartins.eng.br/g-octave/

You can clone the mercurial repository using this command (with Mercurial
installed, of course)::
    
    $ hg clone http://hg.rafaelmartins.eng.br/g-octave/

The release tarballs can be found here:

http://files.rafaelmartins.eng.br/distfiles/g-octave/


Configuring g-Octave
--------------------

If you installed g-Octave correctly, you should find a configuration file
at ``/etc/g-octave.cfg``.

The main options are ``db`` and ``overlay``, that defines the directory paths
for the package database and the generated overlay, respectively.

Other options are available. Please read the comments in the configuration
file.


Syncronizing the package database
---------------------------------

Currently g-Octave depends on an external package database, in order to
create the ebuilds for the packages. You'll need to fetch this database
in the first time that you run g-Octave: ::
    
    # g-octave --sync


Configuring your package manager
--------------------------------

Portage needs to be able to find the ebuilds generated by g-Octave, then
you'll need to add the directory path of the overlay (configured in the
previous step) to the variable ``PORTDIR_OVERLAY``, in the file
``/etc/make.conf``.

You can use something like this command: ::
    
    # echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/path/to/your/overlay ${PORTDIR_OVERLAY}"' >> /etc/make.conf


Installing packages
-------------------

You can list all the available packages using this command: ::
    
    # g-octave --list

or ::
    
    # g-octave -l

To install a package, use: ::
    
    # g-octave packagename

or ::
    
    # g-octave packagename-version

For example: ::
    
    # g-octave control-1.0.11

g-octave command tool supports some options for the installation of
packages:
    
``-a`` or ``--ask``
    Ask before install the package
``-p`` or ``--pretend``
    Only pretend the installation of the package

You can get some information about the package using this command: ::

    # emerge --info packagename

or ::
    
    # emerge -i packagename


Uninstalling packages
---------------------

You can uninstall packages using this command: ::

    # emerge --unmerge packagename

or ::
    
    # emerge -C packagename-version

The options ``--ask`` and ``--verbose`` are also supported.
